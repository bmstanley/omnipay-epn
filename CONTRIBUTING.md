# Contributing Guidelines

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important to ensure that the functionality doesn't break in a future version.
* Commit just the modifications, do not mess with the composer.json or CHANGELOG.md files.
* Ensure your code is nicely formatted in the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
  style and that all tests pass.
* Send the pull request.
* Check that the Travis CI build passed. If not, rinse and repeat.
